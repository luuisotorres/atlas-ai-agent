    "text": "(bright upbeat music) - December 19th, 1978, Malcolm Caldwell, a Professor at the University of London, boards a plane to Cambodia\nfor a historic trip. It's an opportunity so rare\nthat Caldwell and his friends hope that it could potentially\nchange the world forever. Three days later, Caldwell would die in one of the dumbest ways imaginable, and this is why intellectuals\nare fucking idiots. Malcolm Caldwell was a\nconsummate intellectual, and as we'll see, he was also\na complete and total idiot. He spent his entire life\nstudying Southeast Asian history and economic development. As a result, Caldwell\nbecame a staunch Marxist. Just to give you an idea, Caldwell visited North Korea in the 1960s and he came away saying\ngood things about it. So, when Communist\nrevolutionaries took control of Cambodia in 1974,\nCaldwell was enthusiastic. The new Communist leader of Cambodia was a man by the name of Pol Pot and he is a radical new agenda of how to create a communist utopia. Caldwell believes that\nPol Pot could finally be the communist leader\nthat he's been waiting for, but the truth is that Pol Pot\nis as insane as he is cruel. And at the time, this is obvious to pretty much anyone paying attention. In the four years Pol Pot is in power, it's estimated that he's\nresponsible for the death of more than 20% of the entire population. But when this news of\ngenocide and atrocities began to leak out to the wider world, Caldwell refuses to believe it. This unwavering support\neventually earns him an invitation to visit Cambodia by the regime. He accepts. In December of 1978, he boards\nthat fateful plane to Asia. Caldwell spends a few\ndays touring the country, on the last day, he's granted an audience\nwith Pol Pot himself. Now, reportedly Caldwell was euphoric with excitement and anticipation. Once in private Caldwell and Pol Pot had a long intellectual conversation. (gentle music) In his enthusiasm, Caldwell began sharing some of his ideas for Cambodia, and at some point he likely said something that Pol Pot took to be criticism, because well, soon after\nthe conversation ended, Pol Pot had Caldwell killed. (tense music) (gentle music) Now, Malcolm Caldwell is\nwhat I like to refer to as an intelligent idiot, a man\nwith an encyclopedic breadth of knowledge and understanding, yet absolutely no idea\nhow to use any of it. And that's what this video\nis about, intelligent idiots, because today's world\nseems to be full of them, and it's, well, it's becoming a problem. Take the recent study that\nasks 30 behavioral scientists to predict which interventions\nwould motivate people to go to the gym more often. Not only were these scientists\npredictions horribly wrong, but get this, they were worse than random guesses of\na person off the street. Or consider the fact that\nover 91% of fund managers cannot beat the market despite the fact that the\nentire purpose of a hedge fund is to explicitly create better\nreturns than the market. Or an ongoing 20-year study\nthat is consistently found that 90% of professional\nwine tasters are no better in blind taste tests than random chance at identifying more expensive wine. What the hell is going on here? Well, to explain, we need to\nstart in a very strange place, a President, a CEO, and a\nhorribly unsuccessful war. (bright upbeat music) March 28th, 1961, the\nnewly elected president, John F. Kennedy, appoints\nthe CEO of Ford Motors, Robert McNamara, to become\nhis Secretary of Defense. This is a seismic decision as McNamara is a completely unconventional choice, a CEO from the private sector\nwith no military background, no Washington connections,\na total outsider, and to boot, the youngest\nSecretary of Defense in US history. McNamara is also an intellectual. He's a statistician. He's a lover of data\nand predictive models, and upon confirmation,\nMcNamara's big innovation is that he's going to\nbring quantitative analysis of manufacturing to\nthe actual battlefield. The US Military is about to get a serious upgrade in efficiency. Now, a few years later, the\nUS enters the Vietnam War, partly on the basis of\nMcNamara's confidence of his own ability to use data analytics to read the battlefield. He decides to measure everything,\narmaments, troop counts, casualties, supply chains, and make sure that every decision is based solely on the\nfacts on the ground. And once in the war, his data analysis consistently\nshows the same result. The US is winning easily,\nhandily year after year. They're committing fewer resources, fewer troops, sustaining fewer casualties, and controlling more land than the enemy. Military victory McNamara promises is right around the corner, or at least that's what\nthe intellectuals claimed, but the years go on and\nthe victory never comes. Because here's what McNamara's\ndata doesn't measure."

    "text": "The North Vietnamese willingness to suffer and die for their country, the poor morale of the US troops, the corruption of the South\nVietnamese government, the shifting political wins at home. The truth is the US is losing and has been losing for\nalmost the entire war, and everyone kind of\nknows it except McNamara. Intellectuals create models of the world. That's kind of their purpose. That's what makes them intellectuals. In theory, these models\nreflect and measure reality in a way that allows\nus to quantify progress and predict the future. The problem is you can't\nmeasure everything. It's impossible. And if it turns out that\nthe immeasurable factors are actually more important\nthan what's measurable, well, then like McNamara,\nyou're kind of screwed. But here's another major issue. Getting accurate data in the first place. On the surface data seems\nreally straightforward. You just go out and measure\nwhatever you need to measure, but what if the way you\nchoose to measure something actually changes the results? For example, there's a popular concept in health and nutrition\nworld known as Blue Zones. You've probably heard of them. - You explain the Blue Zones. - Places around the world. - Where people live extremely long lives. - Is there anything\nscientifically different about these Blue Zones? - A lot of the Blue Zones eat lemons. - We can Blue Zone our\nown house if we want to. - Blue Zones are\ncommunities around the world that produce a higher\namount of 100-year olds. People have suggested that we\nshould study these Blue Zones to figure out how they live longer, and as a result, the\nBlue Zone model of health has become incredibly popular\nover the past 20 years, spawning bestselling books, a\nmultimillion dollar business, and a Netflix documentary, not to mention hundreds of YouTube videos. - Here's to the beginning\nof our Blue Zone adventure. - And this is great\n(chuckles) except it wasn't. See, it turns out that\nupon closer inspection, a lot of the data behind the\nBlue Zones is, well, bad. For example, each of the Blue\nZones happened to be in places where birth certificates were\neither adopted oddly late, or were largely destroyed in a war. All of the Blue Zones involved countries that were at war in the mid 20th century and had drafts with upper age limits, giving young people incentives\nto lie about their age. Two of the five Blue Zones\nhad major pension law changes that gave older people more money, another incentive to lie about one's age. And most interestingly, while the Blue Zones are\noverrepresented in 100-year olds, they are underrepresented in 90-year olds. Interesting. The point here is that the Blue Zone model of health and longevity isn't\nnecessarily a bad model, the problem is that it's\nbuilt on top of bad data, therefore it's not accurately\nreflecting reality. Yet, of course, nobody thinks about that. Netflix definitely didn't. But here's the real problem. Intellectuals forget that\nmodels are just models. Instead, they come to believe\nthat their models are reality and the consequences can be disastrous. Malcolm Caldwell spent 20 years studying Southeast Asian\nhistory and development. He created a model of understanding\nthat part of the world that was largely Marxist. Then when he actually\nwent to Southeast Asia and met an actual Marxist and\ntried to tell that Marxist all about his model,\nit didn't end so well. When an intellectual\nmodel and reality collide, reality always wins. Yet when their models are\ncontradicted by reality, most intellectuals do\nnot side with reality. On the contrary, most\nintellectuals will double down on their models, and this\nis what makes them idiots. By the way, do you wanna\navoid being an idiot? Of course you do. This video is brought to you by Shortform, the book summary app that\nhelps you seem way smarter than you actually are. Some people feel like\nreading book summaries is like cheating on a test, but I actually don't see it that way. In fact, I think book\nsummaries, critiques, and commentary can be used\nas a way to prevent yourself from becoming an intellectual idiot. I use Shortform as a\ntool to help me decide whether a book is worth reading or not, to see if the idea in it are solid, and to help me review books\nthat I read years ago, but have somewhat forgotten. Also, if a book is poorly written or just like an absolute\npain to get through, I say, screw it. I pull up the Shortform\nsummary and I get it over with. Shortform summaries are\nactually pretty damn good too. I checked out the summaries of my books and I have to say they nailed it. They even got that I'm an\nexistentialist and not a stoic, which pretty much everybody fucks that up. Anyway, use the link below to\nget 20% off your membership. You'll get access to\nall of their summaries, their app, everything. Check it out, use the link\nbelow, link in the description. Moving on. (gentle music) In 1968, the biologist Paul\nEhrlich began his book, \"The Population Bomb,\" with\nthe following sentence. \"The battle to feed all\nof humanity is over. In the 1970s, hundreds\nof millions of people will starve to death. At this late date, nothing can prevent a substantial increase\nin the world death rate.\" In the book, Ehrlich builds a case that the world is overpopulated, and we would soon experience\ncatastrophic social, economic and environmental collapse. He predicted that all marine\nlife would die by 1980, that over 1 billion people\nwould die due to famine by 1990,"

    "text": "and that England would no\nlonger exist by the year 2000. - We're very close to a worldwide plague that could kill virtually everybody. - The book was a massive\nhit in an inspired political and social movements across the world. - There's too many people and we'd like to see\npeople have fewer children and better ones. - Ehrlich became an internationally celebrated thought leader and luminary. - Have to get the death rate\nand birth rate in balance, and there's only two ways to do it. One is to bring the birth rate down, the other is to push the death rate up. - He was featured in newspapers and appeared on television\nall over the world. He was achieving what every intellectual hopes\nto achieve, real impact. Except that he was completely and utterly wrong about everything. But Ehrlich didn't let that stop him. In 1990, he doubled\ndown with another book. In 2004 he stated in an interview that his only mistake in his first book was that his predictions\nwere too optimistic. In 2008, he argued that\ngovernments should not allow people to have more than two children. Even last year in 2024, he was\ninterviewed on \"60 Minutes,\" one of the most prestigious news programs in the United States. Ehrlich is the poster child\nfor an intellectual idiot. Here you have a guy, super\neducated, Professor at Stanford, spends decades thinking\nabout sustainability, and he comes up with a model. The model makes some\ncatastrophic predictions. He is then rewarded for the model. He's told he's a genius, he's a visionary. Oh, my God, he's saving\nthe planet, and humanity, and the baby seals. Oh, my God, the baby seals. He gets paid for this model. He wins awards for this model. He becomes world famous for this model, but reality eventually\nmakes a fool of every model, and the intellectuals who\nclinging to their models in the face of reality become idiots. Idiots don't update their\nviews about the world when new information comes out. Idiots try to shut down discourse rather than engage with it. Idiots will look at\nsomething plain and obvious and claim that it's actually\nreally complicated, you see? Because if you factored the\nbinomial of the quantum rate of the social construct and\ndivide by zero, you'll discover, just like Plato once said,\nthat what is right is right, if only what is right is left, and what's left is alleviates\nthe burden of the proletariat to liberation of all\npeople's, even under God, whatever and ever, amen. (tense music) Look, the world is a scary\nand unpredictable place. It is human nature to crave some model to give it some sense of predictability. But the real problem is\nthat our models of reality also give us an identity\nin a sense of belonging. I mean, look at these fucking nitwits. Do you think this is really\nabout climate change? No, these are empty, angry human beings, desperate for their\nlives to mean something in the face of the void. And their apocalyptic climate change model has done that for them. But we all have to be careful, because the fact that\nour models give our lives a sense of meaning, means that all of us are\nsusceptible to becoming idiots if we're not careful. And this is how we prevent that. (bright music) You get a lot of information\nfrom the internet, that's great because you can be conscious of what you're consuming and choose whether to learn\nmore about a topic or not. But the fact that you are\nchoosing which models to adopt and believe in for yourself, means that you are an intellectual now, and as an intellectual, you are never far from\nturning into an idiot. All this alternative media,\nif I can call it that, has a kind of paradox to it. On the one hand, it's great\nat exposing the disconnect between the intellectual elite and the actual on the ground\nreality of millions of people. Idiots like Malcolm\nCaldwell can now be spotted a mile away on Twitter before\nthey even have a chance to get shot in the face by a communist. But there is something more\nsubtle happening as well, and it concerns me deeply. On the internet, the models of the world that travel the furthest\nare not the most accurate. - Every single day- - The most attention grab- - They become less intelligent. - Woke past one purpose. - Not a single friend that\nshowed up to the birthday party. - They're the models\nthat appeal most strongly to our base instincts,\nprejudices, and emotional needs. And by and large, these\nattention grabbing models of the world are inaccurate at best and actively destructive at worst. And because we're spending more time on our devices removed\nfrom the real world, we are less likely to\nsuffer the consequences that a faulty model give us. - By doing what the world (crosstalk) - Put another way, the less\ntime we spend in the real world, the less of a cost we experience\nfor being detached from it. And you and I, and everyone\nmust go through pains to remember this all the time. This is not reality. This is a cheap 2D rendition of reality, a fun house mirror of reality. It is a cheap imitation and temporary substitute for reality. So, what does that mean? That means less time on this stupid device and more time out in the world. That means meet more people\nface to face, talk to them, connect with them, disagree\nwith them, care about them. The more emotionally satiated you are"

And then with the emotional sustenance of real world relationships\nsupporting you, approach the models of the world with a healthy dose of skepticism. All models are wrong,\nbut some can be useful. If a model is useful, use it, but the moment it's not,\nabandon it and move on. (bright upbeat music)"
