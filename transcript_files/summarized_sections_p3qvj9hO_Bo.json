    "summary": "# Understanding Databases and the Importance of SQL\n\nA **database** is a structured collection of data organized into tables, each representing different models or entities such as users, products, or orders. Tables contain rows, known as records, each representing an instance of the model, while columns hold the properties of these records, like ID, name, or email. This organization allows for complex data relationships through **relational databases**, linking data across different tables efficiently.\n\n**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is essential because it is the primary language for managing and interacting with databases. SQL is pervasive due to the universal need to store and retrieve data across applications, regardless of platform or scale. Proficiency in SQL is crucial for developers, as nearly all software applications interact with data in some form. Mastering SQL provides the skills necessary for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data—known as CRUD operations—and can significantly enhance a developer's capabilities.\n\nThe tutorial aims to further explore SQL through MySQL Workbench, focusing on SQL syntax and various commands used for data operations.\n\n## Key Points\n- A database is a structured collection of data organized into tables.\n- Tables represent different models, with rows as records and columns as properties.\n- Relational databases connect data among different tables.\n- SQL manages and interacts with databases and is crucial for any developer due to its widespread use.\n- Mastery of SQL enhances a developer’s efficiency in data management tasks.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"Essentially a database is just a collection of data and separated out into different tables.\"\n- \"SQL deals with data, and data is everywhere… databases which use SQL are one of the greatest and easiest ways to store data.\"\n\n"

    "summary": "# SQL Basics and Syntax Overview\n\nSQL syntax is essential to understand for executing queries effectively. Using tools like MySQL Workbench allows for executing SQL commands within created query tabs, where syntax understanding becomes crucial. SQL utilizes a simple set of commands or keywords such as **SELECT**, **FROM**, and **WHERE**, which appear in distinct colors in many code editors to differentiate them from other elements. Notably, these keywords are case-insensitive, enabling flexibility in writing them. However, adhering to best practices, like using uppercase for keywords, helps distinguish them from table and column names, which typically are in lowercase. Additionally, including a semicolon at the end of SQL statements is a good habit, especially when writing multiple queries to ensure they are correctly separated.\n\n## Key Points\n- SQL commands use keywords like **SELECT**, **FROM**, and **WHERE** that can be recognized in code editors by color.\n- Keywords in SQL are case-insensitive, but it's standard to write them in uppercase.\n- Queries should end with semicolons to separate them when writing multiple commands in one file.\n- Use single quotes to enclose strings within SQL commands.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"Even though the keywords can be written in all caps or all lowercase, it is almost always best practice and the standard to write all of your keywords in full uppercase.\""

    "summary": "# Introduction to Creating and Dropping Databases in SQL\n\nIn this lesson, we will learn how to create and manage databases using SQL, using a record company example with tables for bands, albums, and songs. The process begins with crafting a database and understanding different methods to execute SQL commands effectively. It’s crucial to understand both the creation and deletion processes to manage databases efficiently.\n\nCreating a new database on a SQL server involves using the straightforward `CREATE DATABASE` command. Although the creation might not immediately reflect in the user interface, refreshing the schema displays the database structure. In contrast, the `DROP DATABASE` command is used to delete a database and all its data, which is irreversible and should be approached with caution.\n\n## Key Points\n- Databases can be created using the `CREATE DATABASE` command followed by the name of the database.\n- SQL commands can be executed by either running the entire script or specific highlighted sections.\n- MySQL Workbench may require a UI refresh to display newly created databases.\n- The `DROP DATABASE` command completely removes a database and all associated data, which is a seldom-used operation as it leads to data loss.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"This command is super straightforward: just write the words 'create' and then 'database' and the name of the database you want to create.\"\n- \"Dropping a database deletes all of the data inside of that database—it’s something you are almost never going to use.\""

    "summary": "# Creating and Managing a Database in SQL\n\nIn SQL, creating and managing databases involves several key steps like creating the database, selecting the correct one for queries, and defining tables with appropriate columns and data types. Initially, one might create an unwanted database, but knowing how to mitigate this is beneficial. The process of creating a **record company** database is straightforward—use the command `CREATE DATABASE` followed by the database name. After creation, ensure to specify which database your SQL file should interact with using the `USE` command. This is crucial because it directs your SQL queries to execute on the intended database, such as the newly created **record company** database in this example.\n\nWhen creating tables within the database, the `CREATE TABLE` command is used. The definition of a table includes naming it and specifying its columns, including data types, within parentheses. The example given outlines creating a test table with one integer column named `test_column`. Data types like `INT`, `STRING`, `DATE`, etc., need to be appropriately defined to reflect the kind of data stored, ensuring the database comprehends what's being managed.\n\n## Key Points\n- **Database Creation**: Use `CREATE DATABASE` followed by the database name to set up a new database.\n- **Selecting a Database**: Use the `USE` command to direct your SQL queries to run on a specific database.\n- **Table Creation**: Utilize `CREATE TABLE` to establish a new table and define its columns and data types.\n- **Data Types**: Indicate data types such as `INT` to convey what type of data each column will store.\n- **SQL Syntax**: Place a semicolon at the end of the full SQL command instead of after each line for proper execution.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"When we run commands such as creating tables or adding data, it'll add it and create it on the record company database.\""

    "summary": "# Managing Database Tables: Adding and Dropping Columns\n\nIn relational databases, modifying tables post-creation without losing existing data is crucial. This section focuses on using the **ALTER TABLE** command to add new columns and the **DROP TABLE** command to remove tables. Initially, a **test table** containing an integer column was created. However, if additional columns are needed later without recreating and losing data, **ALTER TABLE** comes into play. To add a column, specify the table name, the column to add, its type (such as a string using **VARCHAR**), and its maximum length.\n\nAfter executing the command, refreshing the schema reveals the new column. Similarly, removing an unwanted table is as simple as using **DROP TABLE** followed by the table name, which deletes it from the schema without hassle.\n\n## Key Points\n- Use **ALTER TABLE** to add columns to existing tables without data loss.\n- Define new columns by specifying name, type, and attributes, like maximum length for a **VARCHAR** type.\n- SQL statements can include line breaks, but execution concludes with a semicolon.\n- **DROP TABLE** allows for easy removal of tables from the database schema.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"This will create a string column with a max length of 255 that is going to be named another column.\"\n- \"SQL actually doesn't care about line breaks in the statement; it just reads it until it sees this semicolon.\""

    "summary": "# Creating a Table for Bands in a Record Company Database\n\nTo manage bands within a record company database, establishing a dedicated table is essential. This table, named **bands**, can store each band's distinct information. The primary data requirement for a band is its name, but there's potential for duplicate names across bands. Thus, a unique identifier, or ID, is crucial to differentiate one band from another.\n\nThe table design begins with a `name` column, which is a **VARCHAR** with a length of 255. To ensure every band has a name, the column is set to **NOT NULL**. This means any attempt to add a band without a name will trigger an error. To uniquely identify bands regardless of name, an **ID** column is introduced. This column uses integers and is also **NOT NULL**. Importantly, it is set to **AUTO_INCREMENT**, which automatically assigns a unique sequential number to each new band entry. This automation avoids manual assignment and simplifies the process of adding new entries.\n\n## Key Points\n- The **bands** table includes a `name` column, with a **VARCHAR(255)** type and **NOT NULL** constraint, ensuring all entries have a band name.\n- An **ID** column is included to uniquely identify each band. It uses an INTEGER type, is **NOT NULL**, and is set to **AUTO_INCREMENT** for automatic sequential ID generation.\n- Columns are separated by commas in the SQL command to clearly define their distinctiveness.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"We never want a band to not have a name... this says that our column can no longer have any null values inside of it.\"\n- \"In almost every table that you create inside of a database, you're going to want to add an ID column.\""

    "summary": "# Defining Primary Keys and Creating Tables in SQL\n\nIn SQL, a **primary key** is a crucial concept used to uniquely identify each record within a table. It ensures that each entry in the table is distinct. By marking the ID column as a primary key, you facilitate efficient querying and indexing. When creating tables, such as **Bands** and **Albums**, defining a primary key helps maintain data integrity and speeds up data retrieval.\n\nWhen constructing tables, the ID column is often utilized as a primary key. It is defined with attributes such as `INTEGER` type, `NOT NULL` constraints (ensuring it is never empty), and `AUTOINCREMENT` to automatically generate subsequent IDs for new records. This systematic approach helps manage data efficiently.\n\n## Key Points\n- **Primary Key**: A primary identifying column that ensures each record in the table is unique.\n- **ID Column**: Typically used as a primary key, defined as `INTEGER`, `NOT NULL`, and `AUTOINCREMENT`.\n- **Indexing**: SQL uses the primary key to quickly differentiate records during queries, improving performance.\n- **Table Structure**: Consists of defined columns with specific data types, constraints, and relationships to other tables.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"A primary key is the primary identifying column for that table and that's what you use to say that this is unique.\"\n- \"Inside of that bands table, we have these different columns and you'll also see that we have an index for our primary key.\""

    "summary": "# Implementing Foreign Keys in Database Tables\n\nWhen managing database relations, specifically between albums and bands, it's essential to establish clear references using IDs. Each album cannot encapsulate all details about its band; instead, it should refer to a separate band table. This relationship is achieved by adding a **band ID column** to the album table. This ID acts as a foreign key, linking each album to its corresponding band.\n\nEvery album entry necessitates a band ID, ensuring that no album exists without a band association. In the table setup, the **primary key** will remain the album's ID, while the **band ID** functions as a foreign key. This foreign key is critical as it links the album table to the band table by referencing the band's unique ID.\n\nSetting up this relationship involves defining the foreign key constraint in SQL. This constraint ensures that any band ID entered into the album table already exists in the band table. This also prevents the deletion of band records if there are dependent album entries, enforcing database integrity.\n\nEnsure the SQL references the table name correctly throughout the code to avoid errors, such as mistakenly referring to \"band\" instead of the correct table name \"bands.\"\n\n## Key Points\n- Albums reference bands using a **band ID**, ensuring clear relationships rather than duplicating data.\n- The **band ID** is a foreign key, linking albums to the band table, while the album's ID remains the primary key.\n- SQL foreign key constraints maintain integrity by verifying existing relationships and preventing unlawful deletions.\n- Correct table references are crucial for successful SQL operations.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"Band ID acts as a foreign key, linking each album to its corresponding band.\""

    "summary": "# Populating and Querying a Database\n\nThis section explores the process of populating a SQL database with data and querying it effectively. After establishing the necessary tables, like an **albums table** linked via a foreign key to a **band table**, we can proceed to populate our database. The **`INSERT INTO`** command is employed to add entries to the bands table, specifying only columns that do not automatically generate, such as ID. By default, ID columns auto-generate to streamline including multiple entries at once. For instance, the commands illustrate how to insert singular entries, such as adding \"Iron Maiden\" to the bands table, and demonstrate how bulk insertions can be done using a comma-separated list of values within the same SQL command. It's shown that adding a new band requires only specifying the band name due to the auto-generated ID feature.\n\n## Key Points\n- **Foreign Key Relationships**: The albums table is linked to the band table using a foreign key, optimizing data access and integrity.\n- **Data Insertion**: Utilize the `INSERT INTO` command, followed by the table name and the columns that need data insertion. Columns with auto-generated IDs do not require values to be specified.\n- **Bulk Insertions**: Multiple entries can be inserted efficiently with a single SQL command by using a comma-separated format.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"We've finally gotten all the tables that we needed created, we can actually start working on adding data to our tables and querying that data both from our tables because that's really what SQL is for: adding data and reading that data.\"\n- \"So let's just add Iron Maiden to our database...you'll see that nothing happens, but we've actually added that band into our database.\""

    "summary": "# Working with SQL Commands for Data Management\n\nIn this section, the process of inserting and querying data using SQL commands is explained. It begins by adding entries into a database table, specifically a band table in which each row is assigned a unique, auto-incremented ID when inserting new bands such as Avenged Sevenfold and Band Anchor. The command for querying data utilizes the `SELECT` statement, which allows you to either select all columns with `*` or specify particular columns. To limit the number of results, the `LIMIT` clause is used. Additionally, you can rename columns in the result set using `AS` for better readability or integration with other programs.\n\n## Key Points\n- Inserting data involves adding multiple entries to a table with an auto-incremented unique ID.\n- The `SELECT` command is used to query data, allowing all columns to be selected with `*` or specific columns by name.\n- The `LIMIT` clause can restrict the number of rows returned by the query.\n- Specific columns can be selected by name, excluding unnecessary columns such as IDs.\n- Column names can be altered in query results using `AS` to create more readable aliases.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"To query the data from our table we're going to use the `SELECT` command.\"\n- \"You can actually rename the columns in order to be easier to be read or used inside of your program.\""

    "summary": "# SQL Column Aliases and Ordering\n\nIn SQL, you can rename column headers using aliases, making future queries simpler and more intuitive. Aliases are defined with the `AS` keyword and allow for reference in subsequent SQL operations. Moreover, the `SELECT` statement can control the order of data by using the `ORDER BY` clause. By default, entries are arranged in ascending order, but this can be reversed with the `DESC` keyword, providing flexibility in data presentation. Additionally, inserting data into a table uses the `INSERT INTO` statement, specifying the target table and columns, along with the values for each entry.\n\n## Key Points\n- **Aliases**: Assign custom names to columns to simplify queries and improve readability.\n- **Ordering**: Use `ORDER BY` to sort query results, with `ASC` for ascending and `DESC` for descending order.\n- **Insertion**: `INSERT INTO` is used for adding new records to a table, specifying the table name, columns, and corresponding values.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"Aliases are really useful because you can also reference what you alias later in your execution.\"\n- \"By default, descending is set to ascending, which gave us the alphabetical order the first time.\""

When inputting data, like albums into an 'albums' table, it's essential to provide details such as release year and associated band ID. This ID ties the album to the correct band in the database. For example, the band Iron Maiden, with an ID of 1, has albums like 'Power Slave' (1984) and another with no known release year, both linked using this ID.\n\nBy using SQL queries, one can retrieve specific data. A `SELECT * from albums` command fetches all entries. However, when filtering specific columns, such as album names, SQL allows using `SELECT name from albums`. If removing duplicates is necessary, the `DISTINCT` keyword ensures only unique entries are presented—thus avoiding repeated names like \"Nightmare\" from appearing twice if they belong to different bands.\n\n## Key Points\n- Album data is input with attributes like year and band ID to ensure proper linkage.\n- SQL `SELECT *` retrieves all columns, while `SELECT column_name` fetches specific data.\n- Use `DISTINCT` to avoid duplicate entries in query results.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"You'll notice that Knightmare shows up twice because there are actually two nightmare albums instead of our database.\""

This is particularly useful when filtering for distinct records, such as album entries in a database. In correcting mistakes, like an incorrect album release year, the `UPDATE` command allows for modifications within the database. Initially, issuing an update without a specific condition would apply changes universally to all records, which is usually undesirable. To target a specific record, you use the `WHERE` clause, which filters conditions such as updating the release year of a specific album identified by its unique ID. This conditional updating keeps data integrity intact and is essential for managing diverse database operations efficiently. The `WHERE` clause can be similarly employed in other SQL commands to filter and refine database queries.\n\n## Key Points\n- The `DISTINCT` keyword filters unique rows, eliminating duplicates.\n- `UPDATE` is used to change data, requiring careful application of the `WHERE` clause to target specific records.\n- The `WHERE` clause refines SQL operations, making them efficient by specifying conditions like ID.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"This update method is incredibly useful for when your data changes inside of your database, which is something that is going to happen all the time inside of an application.\""

    "summary": "# SQL Querying Techniques for Filtering Data\n\nTo extract specific records from a database, you can use SQL's `SELECT` statement in combination with the `WHERE` clause to filter data efficiently. If you need albums released before the year 2000, you specify a condition in the `WHERE` clause, such as `release_year < 2000`. This query will return only those albums with a release year prior to 2000. The `WHERE` clause is versatile, enabling filtering by various criteria, including strings.\n\nWhen dealing with strings, you can utilize SQL wildcards for pattern matching. By using the `LIKE` operator combined with `%`, you can filter strings that contain certain sequences of characters at any position. For example, filtering album names that include 'ER' can be done with `%ER%`. This pattern allows any number of characters before or after 'ER'. Additionally, you can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `OR`. For instance, you might query for albums with 'ER' in their name or where the band's ID is 2, allowing for flexible and complex query construction.\n\n## Key Points\n- Use `WHERE release_year < 2000` to select albums released before the year 2000.\n- SQL `LIKE` operator with `%` allows flexible string pattern matching.\n- Combine conditions using `OR` for more comprehensive filtering.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"The `WHERE` clause has so many different ways that you can filter by, and it's incredibly useful.\"\n- \"Just think about `%` as it can be anything; it doesn't really matter.\"\n\n"

    "summary": "# Using SQL WHERE Clauses for Query Filtering\n\nFiltering data using SQL's `WHERE` statement can be versatile and powerful. This technique helps retrieve specific data entries that match particular requirements. By using different conditions and keywords, you can narrow down your dataset to suit your analytical needs.\n\nThe `OR` clause allows for multiple conditions where if any of the conditions are true, the row is returned. In the example of selecting albums based on year and band ID, specific entries like the \"Powerslave\" album from 1984 can be isolated by combining the `AND` condition to fulfill both `release_year` and `band_ID` requirements. \n\nAnother SQL feature for filtering is the `BETWEEN` keyword. This is used to select records with values within a specific range, such as albums released between 2000 and 2018. Additionally, you can filter for null values using `IS NULL` to find records missing data, like a release year. \n\nTo manage unwanted data entries, like a mistakenly entered test album, SQL's `DELETE` command can be used. By pairing it with the `WHERE` clause, specific rows can be removed without affecting the rest of the table.\n\n## Key Points\n- Use `AND` and `OR` in `WHERE` clauses to filter data based on multiple conditions.\n- The `BETWEEN` keyword can filter records within a specified range.\n- Use `IS NULL` to retrieve records without a specific value, like an undefined release year.\n- Apply `DELETE` with a `WHERE` clause to remove specific entries by condition, avoiding unintended deletions.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"We can use the between keyword... we get only albums released between 2000 and 2018.\"\n- \"If we run this right now it'll delete every single row from our albums table which we definitely do not want to do.\""

    "summary": "# Introduction to SQL Joins and Basic Operations\n\nIn the realm of SQL, managing data revolves around four primary operations: **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** (CRUD). These operations form the foundation of SQL's power in database management. However, SQL offers additional, more sophisticated features, such as the **JOIN** statement, which boosts SQL's capability by allowing the user to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns, enhancing data interaction and relationships within the database.\n\nThe `JOIN` statement in SQL is particularly potent as it allows joining two tables, such as a `band` table and an `album` table, on shared attributes (e.g., `band ID`). By joining tables, SQL users can create complex and informative queries that display data from both tables when specified conditions are met—such as matching `band ID` values in our example. This method epitomizes SQL's utility in representing relationships within data, pivotal for robust database applications.\n\n## Key Points\n- SQL operates primarily with CRUD commands: **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, **Delete**.\n- The **JOIN** statement connects two tables based on a common attribute, enabling complex data queries.\n- A basic join query involves selecting data from one table and joining it with another, comparing row values for specified common columns.\n- The example provided returns combined data from the `bands` table and the `albums` table where their `ID` values match.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"This is really the cornerstone to everything that you need to do with SQL.\"\n- \"It really allows us to create powerful queries that allow us to create relations between our data inside of our database, which is what makes SQL so powerful.\""

    "summary": "# Understanding SQL Joins: Inner, Left, and Right Joins\n\nSQL joins are a powerful feature used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column. This section focuses on practical examples of **inner joins**, **left joins**, and **right joins** within MySQL, illustrating how data is retrieved depending on the type of join used.\n\nAn **inner join** retrieves records with matching values in both tables. For example, when executing a query to gather band and album information, the same band may appear multiple times if they have more than one album. This occurs because the join operation lists the band once per associated album.\n\nThe **left join** is used to return all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table, or `NULL` if there is no match. This means that bands without any albums will still appear in the results. Conversely, a **right join** returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If albums exist without associated bands, they would still show up in the results when using a right join, but such scenarios were not present in this example.\n\n## Key Points\n- An **inner join** returns only the rows with matching values between the two tables.\n- A **left join** includes all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table, showing `NULL` where no matches exist.\n- A **right join** includes all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.\n- SQL joins help in extracting meaningful relationships between datasets like showing a band for each album or vice versa.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"You’ll also notice that the Iron Maiden row is actually duplicated here and that's because it has two different albums associated with that single band.\"\n- \"A left join will allow us to have all of the bands that don’t have any albums show up.\"\n- \"If we wanted to do a right join, it would join on the right side... if there is an album with no band associated, it would still return that album.\""

    "summary": "# Understanding SQL Joins and Aggregate Functions\n\nSQL joins are powerful tools for querying relational databases, facilitating the combination of data from multiple tables based on shared keys or columns. Among the different types of joins, the **inner join** and **left join** are the most commonly used, with the **right join** often less utilized due to its similarity to the left join but with reversed table logic. Inner joins fetch records where matching data exists in both tables, whereas left joins return all records from the left table, including those with no corresponding match in the right table.\n\nIn addition to joins, SQL provides **aggregate functions** to perform calculations on data sets, producing summarized results. These functions include operations such as *average*, *sum*, and others, which condense large amounts of data into singular values based on specified criteria or columns.\n\n## Key Points\n- **Inner Joins**: Useful for retrieving records with matching keys in both queried tables.\n- **Left Joins**: Return all records from the left table, and only the matching records from the right table.\n- **Right Joins**: Similar to left joins but flipped; less commonly used and potentially confusing.\n- **Aggregate Functions**: Operations like `AVG` (average) or `SUM` transform column data into singular values representing the dataset's aggregate information.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"Inner joins are really useful when you only want to get records back when there is both a value in the table on the left and the table on the right.\"\n- \"Left joins are really useful when you just want to get absolutely everything from the left-side table... and then just get the things from the right-side table if they exist.\""

    "summary": "# Using Aggregate Functions in SQL with Group By\n\n**Aggregate functions** like `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVERAGE` are essential tools in SQL for performing calculations on data groups. One common scenario involves using `COUNT` along with `GROUP BY` to analyze how many records exist for each unique item in a table, such as counting the number of albums per band by their unique **band ID**. By leveraging `GROUP BY`, SQL allows the aggregation of records by a specific column, which in this case is the band ID. This method reorganizes data from the table by combining rows with identical values in the designated column (band ID), running the aggregate function over these groups instead of over the whole table, resulting in a summary row for each unique band ID.\n\nRunning this query will reveal how many albums exist for each band, with band ID 1 having two albums, and band IDs 2 and 3 each having one. These aggregate functions fundamentally change how data is processed by allowing calculations on sets of rows that share specific attributes. Understanding and effectively using `GROUP BY` can unlock more advanced SQL techniques, such as combining it with `JOINS` to create powerful, comprehensive queries.\n\n## Key Points\n- **Aggregate functions** compute values across a range of data rows and return a single summary value.\n- **`COUNT`** can be used with `GROUP BY` to determine the number of records per category, such as counting albums by band.\n- **`GROUP BY`** groups data that shares a specified column value into single records for aggregate analysis.\n- The result shows distinct groups (e.g., per band) as separate rows, applying the aggregate function to each group.\n- Further SQL complexity can be achieved by integrating `GROUP BY` with `JOINS` to create more detailed data queries.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"Group by takes all of the records and groups them by a single column inside of that table.\""

By performing these operations, unique entries for bands, along with a count of their albums, can be obtained. Although initially complex, practice can enhance understanding of these tasks.\n\n**Filtering by aggregates** involves using a **HAVING** clause instead of a **WHERE** clause. This is because in SQL, the **WHERE** clause operates before **GROUP BY** while **HAVING** evaluates after, thus allowing you to filter aggregated data like a count of albums. You can set conditions on these aggregates through **HAVING** to narrow down data returns, such as finding bands with exactly one album.\n\nAdditionally, you can still use **WHERE** alongside to filter data pre-grouping or alongside conditions like band names.\n\n## Key Points\n- Counts of zero occur correctly for bands without album records.\n- **HAVING** is used for filtering aggregate functions because it evaluates after **GROUP BY**.\n- To refine data to bands with specific album counts, employ **HAVING**.\n- **WHERE** remains usable for other non-aggregate filters like band names.\n\n## Notable Quotes\n- \"It really just takes working through different problems to fully understand this.\"\n- \"HAVING is exactly the same as WHERE but it happens after the GROUP BY.\""
